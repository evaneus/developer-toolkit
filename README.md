# Developer Toolkit

This application will allow developers to launch corespring items and get the source code that was used to launch the item.

## Building

We assume you have node/npm & bower installed
    
    npm install
    node app.js
    
### TODO - having to install so many dependencies to run grunt is a bit of a pain.
 ### Is there an easier way to do this?
